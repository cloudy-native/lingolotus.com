# A Friendly Guide to Thai Grammar

Welcome to the world of Thai grammar! It’s like learning a new game with its own rules, but once you get the hang of it, it’s super rewarding. This guide dives into the Thai alphabet, tone marks, consonant classes (high, low, mid), and vowels. We’ll break it down with tables and example words to make it easier to follow. Let’s jump in and start exploring Thai!

## 1. Thai Alphabet: Your First Step
The Thai alphabet is your gateway to reading and writing. It has 44 consonants, each with a unique sound and a quirky name (like "chicken" or "egg"). Thai is written left to right, with no spaces between words in a sentence—think of it as a flowing stream of letters. Vowels and tone marks tag along to shape the sound and meaning.

- **What’s Cool**: Each consonant has a name that often hints at its sound, making it easier to remember.
- **Example Word**: สวัสดี (sà-wàt-dee, hello) uses ส (so suea) and ด (do dek).
- **Pro Tip**: Start by learning a few consonants a day, and say their names out loud to stick them in your brain.

## 2. Tone Marks: The Music of Thai
Thai is a tonal language, which means the pitch of your voice changes a word’s meaning. Imagine it like singing different notes to the same lyric. There are five tones—mid, low, falling, high, and rising—and four tone marks help you nail the right one. These marks sit above consonants, guiding how you say the word.

| Tone Mark    | Symbol | Tone    | Example Word | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------ | ------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Mai Ek       | ่      | Low     | หมา (mǎa)    | Dog     |
| Mai Tho      | ้      | Falling | ม้า (mâa)     | Horse   |
| Mai Tri      | ๊      | High    | ห้อง (hông)   | Room    |
| Mai Chattawa | ๋      | Rising  | หม้อ (mǒ)     | Pot     |
| None         | -      | Default | สา (sā)      | Line    |

- **How It Works**: The tone depends on the consonant class, vowel length, and tone mark (or lack of one).
- **Example Fun**: Try saying หมา (mǎa, low tone, dog) and ม้า (mâa, falling tone, horse) to hear the difference!
- **Pro Tip**: Listen to native speakers on apps or videos to catch the tone vibes—your ears will thank you.

## 3. High, Low, and Mid Consonants: The Tone Team
Thai consonants are split into three groups—high, mid, and low—which set the stage for a word’s tone. Think of them as the bass, tenor, and alto in a choir, each bringing its own flavor. These classes team up with vowels and tone marks to decide how a word sounds.

| Class | Number | Examples                                    | Example Word | Meaning |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------- |
| Mid   | 9      | ก (ko kai), ด (do dek), บ (bo baimai)       | กา (kā)      | Crow    |
| High  | 11     | ข (kho khai), ฉ (cho ching), ผ (pho phueng) | ขา (khǎ)     | Leg     |
| Low   | 24     | ค (kho khwai), น (no nu), ม (mo ma)         | ค้า (khâ)     | Trade   |

- **Why It Matters**: A mid consonant like ก (k) with a long vowel gives a mid tone (e.g., กา, kā, crow), but a low consonant like ค (kh) with a tone mark changes the game (e.g., ค้า, khâ, trade).
- **Example Fun**: Say กา (kā, mid tone) and ขา (khǎ, rising tone) to feel the consonant class magic.
- **Pro Tip**: Group consonants by class on flashcards to spot patterns in tones.

## 4. Vowels: The Sound Shapers
Thai vowels are like the spices in a dish—they add flavor to consonants. There are 18 single vowels and several diphthongs (vowel combos), which can be short (quick) or long (drawn out). Vowels are written around the consonant—before, after, above, or below—and their length can change a word’s tone and meaning.

| Vowel     | Symbol | Sound | Position     | Example Word | Meaning        |
| --------- | ------ | ----- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Short     | -ะ     | a     | After        | บะ (ba)      | Crazy          |
| Long      | -า     | ā     | After        | บา (bā)      | Lotus          |
| Short     | -ิ      | i     | Above        | กิ (ki)       | (part of word) |
| Long      | -ี      | ī     | Above        | กี (kī)       | (part of word) |
| Diphthong | เ-า    | ao    | Before/After | เกา (kao)    | Scratch        |

- **How It Works**: Vowels follow the consonant in pronunciation, even if written before it (e.g., เกา, kao, starts with k, then ao).
- **Example Fun**: Compare มา (mā, come, long vowel) with มิ (mi, not, short vowel) to hear the difference.
- **Pro Tip**: Practice writing vowels with a consonant like ก (k) to see how they fit together, like a puzzle.

## Wrapping It Up
Thai grammar might seem like a big adventure, but it’s all about piecing together the alphabet, tone marks, consonant classes, and vowels. Start with small words like สวัสดี (sà-wàt-dee, hello) or ข้าว (khâo, rice) to see how these elements play together. Grab a notebook, try writing a few words from the tables, and say them out loud to feel the tones. With practice, you’ll be reading Thai like a pro in no time. Keep exploring, and have fun with it!

## All the Consonants

Thai consonants are divided into three classes: low, mid, and high. This classification affects the tone of words.

**TODO**: this isn't quite riht yet. The English names for the consonants are sometimes not the right now.

### Vowel Positions

Thai vowels can be positioned in different places relative to the consonant:

- **Before**: Written before the consonant but pronounced after (e.g., เ-า)
- **After**: Written after the consonant (e.g., -า)
- **Above**: Written above the consonant (e.g., -ิ)
- **Below**: Written below the consonant (e.g., -ุ)
- **Around**: Written both before and after, or above and below (e.g., เ-ีย)

### Short vs. Long Vowels

The length of a vowel affects the tone of a word:

- **Short vowels** are pronounced quickly (e.g., ะ in กะ)
- **Long vowels** are held longer (e.g., า in กา)

This distinction is crucial for proper pronunciation and meaning in Thai.
