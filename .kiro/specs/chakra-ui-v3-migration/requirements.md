# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Lingo Lotus application from Chakra UI v2 to Chakra UI v3. Chakra UI v3 introduces significant architectural changes including a new theming system, updated component APIs, and improved performance. The migration must maintain all existing functionality while adopting the new patterns and taking advantage of v3 improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade to Chakra UI v3, so that I can benefit from improved performance, better TypeScript support, and the latest component features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use Chakra UI v3 dependencies
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL maintain identical visual appearance and behavior
3. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to Chakra UI
4. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no type errors from Chakra UI components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the theming system to v3 patterns, so that the application uses the new theme structure and benefits from improved customization capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme is configured THEN it SHALL use the new v3 theme structure
2. WHEN custom tokens are defined THEN they SHALL follow v3 token patterns
3. WHEN components use theme values THEN they SHALL reference the correct v3 theme paths
4. WHEN the application renders THEN all existing colors, fonts, and spacing SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update component imports and usage patterns, so that the application uses the correct v3 APIs and import paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are imported THEN they SHALL use v3 import patterns
2. WHEN component props are used THEN they SHALL follow v3 API changes
3. WHEN deprecated components are encountered THEN they SHALL be replaced with v3 equivalents
4. WHEN the application builds THEN there SHALL be no import or usage warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the provider setup, so that the application correctly initializes Chakra UI v3 with proper configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes THEN it SHALL use the v3 ChakraProvider setup
2. WHEN the theme is applied THEN it SHALL be properly configured for v3
3. WHEN the application renders THEN all provider-dependent features SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN SSR occurs THEN there SHALL be no hydration mismatches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain all existing functionality, so that the migration is transparent and doesn't break any features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate the application THEN all pages SHALL render correctly
2. WHEN I interact with components THEN they SHALL behave identically to the v2 implementation
3. WHEN responsive breakpoints are triggered THEN layouts SHALL adapt properly
4. WHEN I use the application THEN there SHALL be no visual regressions or broken functionality
