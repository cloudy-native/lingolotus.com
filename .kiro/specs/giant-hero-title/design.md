# Design Document

## Overview

This design enhances the visual impact of the Lingo Lotus homepage hero section by significantly increasing the size of the main title "ðŸª· Lingo Lotus". The design leverages Chakra UI's responsive sizing system and custom CSS properties to create a striking, scalable title that maintains readability across all devices.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis
- Current title uses Chakra UI `size="2xl"` which maps to approximately 36px font size
- The title is positioned in a Flex layout with responsive direction (column on mobile, row on desktop)
- Existing responsive breakpoints: `base` (mobile), `md` (tablet+)

### Proposed Enhancement
- Implement custom responsive font sizes that go beyond Chakra's standard scale
- Use Chakra UI's responsive object syntax for precise control across breakpoints
- Maintain existing layout structure while dramatically increasing visual impact

## Components and Interfaces

### Typography Scale Enhancement

**Custom Font Sizes:**
- Mobile (base): `fontSize={{ base: "4xl" }}` (~48px) - Large but fits mobile screens
- Tablet/Desktop (md+): `fontSize={{ base: "4xl", md: "6xl", lg: "7xl" }}` (~72-96px) - Maximum impact

**Alternative Approach (Custom CSS):**
If standard Chakra sizes aren't large enough, implement custom responsive values:
```typescript
fontSize={{ 
  base: "3rem",    // 48px - mobile
  md: "4.5rem",    // 72px - tablet  
  lg: "6rem"       // 96px - desktop
}}
```

### Layout Considerations

**Spacing Adjustments:**
- Increase bottom margin to accommodate larger text: `mb={{ base: 6, md: 8 }}`
- Ensure proper line height for readability: `lineHeight={{ base: "1.1", md: "1.0" }}`
- Maintain text alignment responsiveness: `textAlign={{ base: "center", md: "left" }}`

**Container Constraints:**
- Verify the title doesn't overflow the container width
- Ensure proper text wrapping on smaller screens
- Test emoji rendering at large sizes across browsers

## Data Models

### Typography Configuration
```typescript
interface HeroTitleProps {
  fontSize: ResponsiveValue<string | number>;
  lineHeight: ResponsiveValue<string | number>;
  fontWeight: string;
  marginBottom: ResponsiveValue<string | number>;
  textAlign: ResponsiveValue<"left" | "center" | "right">;
}
```

### Responsive Breakpoint Values
```typescript
const heroTitleStyles = {
  fontSize: { base: "4xl", md: "6xl", lg: "7xl" },
  lineHeight: { base: "1.1", md: "1.0" },
  mb: { base: 6, md: 8 },
  textAlign: { base: "center", md: "left" }
};
```

## Error Handling

### Responsive Fallbacks
- If custom font sizes cause overflow, implement `overflow-wrap: break-word`
- Provide fallback font sizes for browsers that don't support the largest values
- Ensure emoji fallbacks for systems without proper emoji support

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Test emoji rendering in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- Verify font scaling behavior on different operating systems
- Implement CSS fallbacks for older browsers

### Performance Considerations
- Large text shouldn't impact page load performance
- Ensure no layout shift during font loading
- Test on low-resolution displays for readability

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Regression Testing
- Screenshot comparison across breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- Cross-browser emoji rendering verification
- Typography scaling validation

### Responsive Testing
- Mobile devices: iPhone SE, iPhone 12, Android phones
- Tablets: iPad, Android tablets
- Desktop: Various screen resolutions (1024px to 4K)

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility with large text and emoji
- Keyboard navigation not affected by size changes
- Color contrast maintained at all sizes

### Performance Testing
- Page load speed impact measurement
- Layout stability during font loading
- Memory usage with large text rendering

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Size Enhancement
1. Update the Heading component with responsive fontSize prop
2. Adjust spacing and line height for optimal readability
3. Test across primary breakpoints

### Phase 2: Fine-tuning
1. Optimize emoji positioning and scaling
2. Adjust container spacing if needed
3. Cross-browser testing and fixes

### Phase 3: Polish
1. Performance optimization
2. Accessibility validation
3. Visual regression testing
