## Notes:
- **Consonant Classes**: Thai consonants are divided into three classes (low, mid, high) which influence tone rules in combination with tone marks and syllable structure.
- **Rhyme Nouns**: These are traditional nouns used in Thai alphabet songs to help children memorize consonants.
- **Initial vs. Final Sounds**: Some consonants change their sound when used at the end of a syllable (e.g., ก, ข, ค all sound like 'k' in final position).
- **Obsolete Consonants**: ฃ and ฅ are no longer used in modern Thai but are included for completeness.
- **Tone Rules**: The class of the consonant affects the tone of the syllable, especially when combined with tone marks or live/dead syllables.
- **Pronunciation Notes**: Aspirated consonants (e.g., ข, ฉ, ถ) have a puff of air, while unaspirated ones (e.g., ก, จ, ต) do not. This distinction is crucial for correct pronunciation.
