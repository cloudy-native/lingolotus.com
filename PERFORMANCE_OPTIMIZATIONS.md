## 📋 Optimizations Applied

### 1. Image Optimization (BIGGEST IMPACT)

#### Problem:
- Unoptimized images: 3-6MB each
- No lazy loading
- No responsive images
- Total: ~25MB of images on homepage

#### Solution:
- ✅ **Gatsby StaticImage** for static images (hero, section images)
- ✅ **LazyImage component** with Intersection Observer for dynamic images
- ✅ **Image optimization script** to compress originals
- ✅ **WebP conversion** via Gatsby (automatic)
- ✅ **Responsive images** with srcset (automatic)

#### Files Changed:
- `src/pages/index.tsx` - StaticImage for hero images
- `src/templates/reading-list.tsx` - LazyImage for book cards
- `src/components/LazyImage.tsx` - NEW lazy loading component
- `scripts/optimize-images.sh` - Image compression script

#### Expected Results:
```
IMG_5673.jpeg: 5.2MB → 200KB (96% reduction)
IMG_5492.jpeg: 5.9MB → 200KB (97% reduction)
bangkok-rainbow.jpeg: 3.1MB → 150KB (95% reduction)
```

### 2. Font loading speed not required

We do not support multiple fonts pr language anymore

---

### 3. Gatsby Performance Flags

None enabled

---

### 4. PWA & Offline Support

#### Plugins Added:
- ✅ `gatsby-plugin-manifest` - PWA capabilities
- ✅ `gatsby-plugin-offline` - Service worker caching

#### Benefits:
- **Subsequent visits:** Near-instant loading (cached)
- **Offline support:** Site works without internet
- **Install prompt:** Can be installed as PWA

#### Files Changed:
- `gatsby-config.ts` - Added manifest and offline plugins

---

### 5. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading

#### Implementation:
- ✅ **Intersection Observer** for lazy image loading
- ✅ **Progressive image loading** with fade-in
- ✅ **Lazy font loading** after initial render
- ✅ **Route-based code splitting** (Gatsby default)

#### Benefits:
- Only load what's visible
- Faster initial page load
- Better perceived performance

## 📝 Best Practices Applied

### Images
- ✅ Use StaticImage for static images
- ✅ Use LazyImage for dynamic images
- ✅ Compress images before committing
- ✅ Max dimensions: 1200x1200px
- ✅ Quality: 85% (optimal balance)

### Fonts
- ✅ Load only essential fonts initially
- ✅ Lazy-load additional weights
- ✅ Use system fonts as fallback

### Code
- ✅ Route-based code splitting
- ✅ Tree shaking enabled
- ✅ Minification in production
- ✅ Source maps only in development

### Caching
- ✅ Service worker for offline support
- ✅ Long-term caching for static assets
- ✅ Cache-busting for updated content

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Recommended:
1. ✅ Run `pnpm run optimize-images` to compress existing images
2. ✅ Install PWA plugins: `pnpm add gatsby-plugin-manifest gatsby-plugin-offline`
3. ✅ Clean rebuild: `pnpm run clean && pnpm run build`
4. ✅ Test with Lighthouse
5. ✅ Deploy optimized build

### Future Optimizations:
- [ ] Consider using CDN for images
- [ ] Add preconnect hints for external resources
- [ ] Implement critical CSS inlining
- [ ] Add resource hints (prefetch, preload)
- [ ] Consider using Brotli compression
