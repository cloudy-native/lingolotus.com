## Notes:
- **Paiboon System**: The Paiboon transliteration reflects Thai pronunciation more phonetically than RTGS, including tone markers (e.g., ˇ for high tone, ^ for rising tone) and vowel length (e.g., aa for long vowels). It’s widely used in language learning materials.
- **Usage Context**: Classifiers are required when counting nouns in Thai, following the structure [noun] + [number] + [classifier]. Omitting classifiers is acceptable only for non-specific quantities (e.g., "some people").
- **Specificity**: Some classifiers are highly specific (e.g., ฟอง for eggs), while others like อัน are general and used when the correct classifier is unknown.
- **Cultural Nuances**: Classifiers like องค์ reflect respect for monks or royalty, aligning with Thai cultural values.
- **Multiple Classifiers**: Some nouns can take different classifiers based on context (e.g., a car can be คัน for the vehicle or ตัว for the car as an object).
- **Learning Tip**: Pairing classifiers with their nouns (e.g., หมา + ตัว) aids memorization. Native speakers may default to อัน for unfamiliar classifiers.
- **Regional Variations**: Classifier usage may vary slightly in regional dialects, but the forms here are standard Thai.

This table includes the most common classifiers, but Thai has additional classifiers for specific or rare contexts. For further study, consulting native speakers or resources like Paiboon language materials is recommended.
