Gatsby combined with Chakra UI and TypeScript creates a powerful foundation for building modern websites. This combination offers the performance benefits of Gatsby, the component flexibility of Chakra UI, and the type safety of TypeScript.

## Why Choose This Stack?

When starting a new web project, choosing the right technologies is crucial. Here's why this combination works so well together:

### Gatsby: Performance and Plugin Ecosystem

Gatsby provides an exceptional developer experience with features like:

- **Fast loading times** through static site generation and intelligent code splitting
- **Image optimization** out of the box
- **Rich plugin ecosystem** that makes adding functionality simple
- **Great SEO capabilities** built-in

### Chakra UI: Accessible and Customizable Components

Chakra UI has quickly become a favorite for React developers because it offers:

- **Accessible components** that follow WAI-ARIA standards
- **Style props** that make customizing components intuitive
- **Dark mode support** built-in
- **Responsive design** made simple with built-in breakpoint handling

### TypeScript: Type Safety and Developer Experience

Adding TypeScript to the mix brings:

- **Fewer runtime errors** through static type checking
- **Better IDE support** with intelligent code completion
- **Self-documenting code** that makes collaboration easier
- **Easier refactoring** when your project grows

## Getting Started

Setting up a new project with this stack is straightforward. This starter template has already configured everything you need, including:

1. Gatsby configuration with TypeScript support
2. Chakra UI theme setup with customizable options
3. Basic components to build upon
4. Blog functionality with Markdown support

```jsx
// Example of a component using Chakra UI with TypeScript
import React from 'react';
import { Box, Heading, Text, Button } from '@chakra-ui/react';

interface HeroProps {
  title: string;
  subtitle: string;
  ctaText: string;
  onCtaClick: () => void;
}

const Hero: React.FC<HeroProps> = ({ 
  title, 
  subtitle, 
  ctaText, 
  onCtaClick 
}) => {
  return (
    <Box textAlign="center" py={20}>
      <Heading as="h1" size="2xl" mb={4}>
        {title}
      </Heading>
      <Text fontSize="xl" maxW="container.md" mx="auto" mb={8}>
        {subtitle}
      </Text>
      <Button colorScheme="blue" size="lg" onClick={onCtaClick}>
        {ctaText}
      </Button>
    </Box>
  );
};

export default Hero;
```

## Building Your First Page

With this template, creating new pages is simple. Just add a new file to the `src/pages` directory, import the components you need, and start building.

The template includes commonly used layout components, SEO optimization, and styling patterns to follow.

## Next Steps

After you've familiarized yourself with the template, you might want to:

1. Customize the theme in `src/theme/index.ts`
2. Add new pages to the `src/pages` directory
3. Create new reusable components in the `src/components` directory
4. Add more blog posts in the `content/blog` directory

This starter is designed to grow with your project, providing a solid foundation while staying out of your way as you build.

Happy coding!
